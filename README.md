# Capstone-Project
For my senior capstone project, Jessica Mean, a highly analytical math undergrad, and I focused our capstone project on the education system and statistics which was each of our passions, respectively. With my extensive knowledge in statistics, I took the lead role as Statistician using R as our main statistical program. We investigated if there existed an achievement gap in our local elementary school district using CAASPP (state mandated) test scores. With the raw data collected, we focused on variables such as economic status, grade level, and their association with student math test scores. Along with data visualization, we ran multiple logistic regression and mixed effect logistic regression tests to see if there was an association between economic status and the probability of failure within each grade level. Based on the data, results showed economic status and grade level had a highly significant affect on the probability of failing the CAASPP math test. This could present itself for a variety of reasons such as lack of parental education and no access to tutors, among others. Our goal was to raise awareness of the achievement gap within our very own community in an effort to bring quality education to future young minds.
